Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights about technology, life, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Cloud engineering and DevOps practices
- Linux and scripting adventures
- Travel experiences and life lessons
- Cricket and other passions
- Professional growth and learning

## About Me

I'm a Cloud Engineer based in Singapore, passionate about Linux, scripting, and cloud technologies. When I'm not working with AWS and Azure, you'll find me playing cricket or exploring new places.

Stay tuned for more posts!
