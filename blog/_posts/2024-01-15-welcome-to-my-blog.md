Welcome to this first post! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights about technology, life, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Road Trips
- Bikes


## About Me

I'm a Cloud Engineer based in Singapore, passionate about Linux, scripting, and cloud technologies. When I'm not working with AWS and Azure, you'll find me playing cricket or exploring new places.

Stay tuned for more posts!
