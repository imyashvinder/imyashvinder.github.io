Welcome to this first post!
You have probably already peeked at the lonely little index.html sitting at the root of a github repo folder, That’s pretty much me in a nutshell. I guess this site will be my dumping ground for half baked thoughts, life experiments, and my rants on how I see things, people, life around me. Will I actually keep it updated ? History says 'NO' but let's just say I'll try and Maybe that’s how you stumble onto something worth writing about. Let’s see…

### What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

Do not stay tuned for more posts!
