Welcome to this first post!
You have probably already peeked at the lonely little index.html sitting at the root of a github repo folder, That's pretty much me in a nutshell. I guess this site will be my dumping ground for half baked thoughts, life experiments, and my rants on how I see things, people, life around me. Will I actually keep it updated ? History says 'NO' but let's just say I'll try and Maybe that's how you stumble onto something worth writing about. Let's seeâ€¦

### What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Things that won't add any value to anyone's life 

### Recent Adventure: KL to Cameron Highlands Motorbike Tour

Recently, I embarked on an exciting motorbike journey from Kuala Lumpur to Cameron Highlands. It was one of those spontaneous decisions that turned out to be absolutely worth it. Here are some highlights from the trip:
