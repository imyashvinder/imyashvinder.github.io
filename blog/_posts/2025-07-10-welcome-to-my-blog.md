Welcome to this first post!
You have probably already peeked at the lonely little index.html sitting at the root of a github repo folder, That’s pretty much me in a nutshell. I guess this site will be my dumping ground for half baked thoughts, life experiments, and my rants on how I see things, people, life around me. Will I actually keep it updated ? History says 'NO' but let's just say I'll try and Maybe that’s how you stumble onto something worth writing about. Let’s see…

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Random things


## About Me

I'm a Cloud Engineer based in Singapore, passionate about Linux, scripting, and cloud technologies. When I'm not working with AWS and Azure, you'll find me playing cricket or exploring new places.

Do not stay tuned for more posts!
